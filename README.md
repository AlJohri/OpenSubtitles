OpenSubtitles
=============

This repository is a collection of scripts that help download and parse the OpenSubtitles corpus.

- opensubtitles.sh: downloads, extracts, and merges the 2012/2013 corpora from http://opus.lingfil.uu.se
- opensubtitles.py: naieve attempt at trying to download a single english subtitle for each imdb id. rate limits at 200 downloads per day

I will be working on further python scripts (with hopefully a better naming convention..) to put this natural language data into a database.
